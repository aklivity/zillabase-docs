# Defining View

Zillabase provides commands to manage data model migrations. Database migration applies changes to the database schema, including tables, views, streams, etc. The Zillabase CLI migration commands help users create an empty migration file that can later be modified to define data models and streams. This migration file format is in SQL format and compatible with PostgreSQL syntax. Under the hood, it uses Risingwave, which acts as a "database" (a streaming database compatible with PostgreSQL-like syntax, to be exact).Â

You can refer to [this article](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) for a complete supported SQL reference.

A view can consume a stream or query from another table. Unlike the materialized view, it only provides a view that depends on the defined query and does not materialize the data. Best for cases where you want to save a view query but don't want the result to be materialized.

1. Create the migration file with the following command:

```sh
# command format
# zillabase migration add <migration-name>

# example
zillabase migration add create_view

# output
# Created migration 000001__create_view.sql
```

After the command succeeds, it prints the new migration file, which you can modify to define your data models. To modify the migration files, open the `zillabase/migrations` folder and edit the corresponding migration file.

2. Edit the migration file with the following content.


```sql
CREATE VIEW user_transactions AS
  SELECT
      encode(zilla_identity, 'escape') AS user_id,
      -amount AS net_amount
  FROM streampay_commands
  WHERE type = 'SendPayment'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
      user_id AS user_id,
      amount AS net_amount
  FROM streampay_commands
  WHERE type = 'SendPayment';
```
